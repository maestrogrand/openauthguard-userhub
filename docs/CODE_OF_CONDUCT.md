# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, I pledge to create an open and welcoming environment for everyone. I am committed to ensuring that my community is inclusive, respectful, and harassment-free for contributors of all backgrounds and experiences.

## My Standards

I expect contributors to:

- **Be respectful**: Treat others with dignity, kindness, and respect. Disagreements should be handled constructively and professionally.
- **Be inclusive**: Respect diverse perspectives, ideas, and experiences. Avoid language or behavior that excludes or discriminates against others.
- **Be collaborative**: Work together to achieve shared goals. Value and appreciate contributions from all participants, regardless of their skill level or experience.
- **Be clear and concise**: Strive to communicate effectively. Provide actionable feedback, write clear documentation, and ensure code contributions are easy to understand.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using inclusive language.
- Being empathetic toward others.
- Offering constructive feedback and help.
- Showing gratitude and recognition for others' contributions.

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination.
- Use of inappropriate language, including derogatory or offensive comments.
